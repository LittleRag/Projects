So far this repository contains 2 different project, 1 survey and 1 shopping list, both of them with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The Survey i created never made it past alpha, but the groundwork is done and all there is to do is hook it up to a server and database, and add more questions.

the shopping list i made is functional, just need a database and a server.
